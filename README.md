# Train-Scheduler

### University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp - Assignment 7

### Getting Started: 

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Basic Specs/Requirements:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.


### Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap Framework
* jQuery 
* Firebase Database
* Moment.js
